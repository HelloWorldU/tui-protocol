# Operation Semantics

| Field | Value |

| Status | Draft |
| Related RFC | [RFC 0001](../rfcs/0001-mutable-terminal-history-and-reading-anchors.md) |

This document consolidates the observable semantics currently agreed for
protocol Operations. It remains non-normative while the protocol is under
development and does not define a wire encoding.

## Operation Index

| Operation | Status |
|---|---|
| [Append](#append) | Pending detailed semantics |
| [Update](#update) | Initial semantics defined |
| [Seal](#seal) | Pending detailed semantics |

## Append

Detailed semantics have not yet been agreed.

## Update

### 1. Target and Validity

`Update` targets a Block by ID. It is valid only while the target Block exists
and remains mutable. Whether its rendered rows are in the active viewport or
scrollback does not affect its eligibility for update.

### 2. Replacement Semantics

An Update carries a complete replacement snapshot of the Block's content. The
target retains its Block ID, lifecycle, and position in append order while the
terminal replaces its content and reflows its presentation.

The terminal may optimize how it realizes an Update, but the observable result
must remain equivalent to complete replacement. A future suffix-only Operation
may optimize streaming without changing these semantics.

### 3. History Integrity

The resulting history contains the replacement and every unaffected Block
exactly once and in the same logical order. The terminal does not realize the
Update by replaying old content into scrollback.

These semantics constrain the completed result. This draft does not yet
require a particular visibility or atomicity policy for intermediate rendering
states.

### 4. Reading Anchor Stability

If the user's reading anchor belongs to a different Block, it remains bound to
the same logical position and keeps its viewport-relative position. A user
following the tail continues to follow the tail.

Mapping a reading anchor through replacement of its own Block remains
undefined.

### 5. Failure Isolation

An Update targeting an unknown or sealed Block is invalid and leaves terminal
state unchanged. A malformed Operation likewise causes no partial mutation and
does not prevent the terminal from processing subsequent input. Error
reporting and recovery on the application side remain wire-level questions.

## Seal

Detailed semantics have not yet been agreed.
